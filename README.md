# 🛡️ CloudGuard Sentinel: Industrial MLOps Platform

**CloudGuard Sentinel** is an end-to-end MLOps platform designed for **Predictive Maintenance** in manufacturing. It predicts machine failures before they happen, preventing costly downtime.

Unlike typical "notebook" projects, this is a **production-grade platform** built with **GitOps** principles, **Infrastructure as Code**, and **Automated Model Governance**.

### The "Senior" Stack

| Component | Tool | Why I Chose It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Infrastructure** | **Terraform (EKS)** | Reproducible infrastructure with secure IAM roles (IRSA). |
| **Deployment** | **Argo CD (GitOps)** | Prevents configuration drift. The cluster state always matches Git. |
| **Orchestration** | **Argo Workflows** | Scalable, container-native training pipelines (not just cron jobs). |
| **Model Registry** | **MLflow** | Centralized tracking for experiments and model versioning. |
| **Serving** | **FastAPI + Polling** | Zero-downtime model updates without restarting pods. |
| **Observability** | **Prometheus** | Custom ML metrics exposed at `/metrics` for inference latency and prediction drift monitoring. |

## 🚀 Key Features (The "Wow" Factors)

### 1. 🛡️ Champion/Challenger Model Evaluation
We don't just deploy models; we **compete** them.
* **The Logic:** When a new model is trained, the pipeline automatically compares its accuracy against the current `@Production` model.
* **The Safety Lock:** If the new model (Challenger) is worse, the pipeline **rejects the deployment**.
* **Evidence:**
    > "New model does not outperform the current production model. Not promoting." — *Pipeline Logs*

### 2. 🔄 True GitOps & Self-Healing
* Application deployment is decoupled from infrastructure.
* **Argo CD** constantly monitors the cluster. If a pod is deleted manually, Argo automatically heals the state.

### 3. 🔐 Enterprise Security (No Keys!)
* **OIDC & IRSA:** This project uses AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts.
* **Zero Long-Lived Credentials:** No AWS Access Keys are hardcoded in the application or GitHub Secrets.

## 🛠️ How to Run This Project

### Prerequisites
* AWS CLI & Terraform installed.
* `kubectl` pointing to an EKS cluster.

### 1. Provision Infrastructure
```bash
cd infra/eks
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### 2. Deploy the GitOps Stack
```bash
# Deploy Argo CD & App of Apps
kubectl apply -f infra/gitops/cloudguard-stack.yaml
```

### 3. Trigger a Training Run
```bash
# Submit the Argo Workflow
kubectl create -f jobs/workflow.yaml
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### 🔒 Security & Compliance
*Transitioning from lab to enterprise production*

- [ ] **AWS SecurityHub Integration**
  - Aggregate findings from GuardDuty (threat detection) and Inspector (vulnerability scanning)
  - Automate compliance checks against CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
  - EventBridge automation: Critical findings → Slack alerts, auto-remediation via Lambda

- [ ] **Network Segmentation**
  - Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication
  - Example: MLflow pods can only communicate with PostgreSQL and S3, not other services

- [ ] **Secrets Management**
  - Migrate from Kubernetes Secrets to AWS Secrets Manager + External Secrets Operator
  - Enable automatic secret rotation for database credentials

- [ ] **Audit Logging**
